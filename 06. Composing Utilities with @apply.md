# Composing Utilities with @apply

a common concern about tailwind is the sheer amount of classes put in your html. The sheer amount of classes is concerning for maintainability and reusability.

## @apply

This is gonna take all the utility classes, compose them, and generate a btn class. with all the styles combined together.

## Start Coding

we're gonna move all of our button's class to globals.css

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
.btn {
  @apply active:bg-indigo-600 focus:ring focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:ring-opacity-50 hover:bg-indigo-400 hover:-translate-y-0.5 transform transition inline-block sm:text-base bg-indigo-500 text-white px-5 py-3 shadow-lg rounded-lg uppercase tracking-wider font-semibold text-sm;
}
@tailwind utilities;
```

we're putting it before the utilities
layer because:
we wanna be able to override a button class with utilities
on a per case basis. (if we define it after the utilities layer, we're not gonna see something happen if we define the padding or margin or stuffs like that)
<br>
to make life easier and you don't have to remember where to put these @apply things
you could use <code>@layer</code>. <code>@layer</code> specifies which of the tailwind layers you wanna write css for.

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer components {
  .btn {
    @apply active:bg-indigo-600 focus:ring focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:ring-opacity-50 hover:bg-indigo-400 hover:-translate-y-0.5 transform transition inline-block sm:text-base bg-indigo-500 text-white px-5 py-3 shadow-lg rounded-lg uppercase tracking-wider font-semibold text-sm;
  }
}
```

## Tips

don't go overboard with apply feature, you should just
stick to a single html element (something like a button,
a headline, a form input)

## Full code

in globals.css

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer components {
  .btn {
    @apply inline-block px-5 py-3 rounded-lg
    focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring focus:ring-opacity-50
    uppercase tracking-wider font-semibold text-sm;
  }
  .btn-primary {
    @apply active:bg-indigo-600
    focus:ring-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-400
    sm:text-base
    bg-indigo-500 text-white;
  }
  .btn-secondary {
    @apply active:bg-gray-600
    focus:ring-gray-500 hover:bg-gray-400
    sm:text-base bg-gray-300
    text-gray-800;
  }
}
```

in index.jsx:

```
          <div className="mt-4 sm:mt-6">
            <a
              className="btn-primary btn shadow-lg hover:-translate-y-0.5 transform transition"
              href="#"
            >
              Book Your Escape
            </a>
            <a className="ml-2 btn btn-secondary" href="#">
              Learn more
            </a>
          </div>
```
