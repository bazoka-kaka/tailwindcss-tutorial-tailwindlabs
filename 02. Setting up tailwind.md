# Setting up Tailwind

1. using cdn (simplest)
2. tailwind css cli (generating our own tailwind file)
3. setup proper dev workflow using frontend build tool
   to compile tailwind also live-server to refresh things
   automatically

## Using CDN

you have to use the link and put it in your HEAD

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
    <!-- tailwind cdn -->
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center text-blue-500">Hello World</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Using Tailwind css cli

first create a css file here:<br>
css --> tailwind.css
<br>
inside tailwind.css:

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

#### note

these are also called the three tailwind directives (three tailwind layers)<br>
@tailwind --> This is a custom post css directives provided by tailwind.<br>
postcss --> a box where transform happens (first you start with some css then runs through some post css plugins then in the other side you get a generated css)

### run the file through postcss

we can use the tailwind css cli

```
> npx tailwindcss-cli build css/tailwind.css -o build/tailwind.css
```

### tailwindcss layers

base --> css reset (for margins, font-sizes, etc)
<br>
components --> a responsive max width container
utilities --> responsible for the vast majority of the css output

## Setting up tailwind in proper workflow

the key thing is the support of framework that we're gonna use for post-css. here, we're gonna use a frontend build tool called vite. vite is gonna take our index.html file as an entry point and run tailwind via postcss also give us a dev server that updates everytime we made changes.
<br><br>
in your terminal:

```
> npm init -y
> npm i -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer vite
```

inside your package.json, configure this:

```
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite"
},
```

before getting started, we have to set our tailwind and postcss.
<br>
in your terminal:

```
> npx tailwindcss init -p
```

<code>-p</code> meaning post css
<br><br>
this is gonna generate tailwind and postcss config files for us.
This is gonna create postcss.config.js and tailwind.config.js file for us. we're gonna use tailwind.config.js file a lot, think of it as
a place where you can customize tailwind.
<br><br>
inside index.html file, replace the cdn with the local tailwindcss file that we created

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/tailwind.css" />
```
